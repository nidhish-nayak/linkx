## How to navigate the project ?

The project consists of two folders "client" and "api". Both are responsible for handling front-end (folder: client) and back-end (folder: api) features respectively. We will be explaining how the client and server folder structures are structured to better understand the architecture of the application.

### Client-side folder structure:

Here's an overview of the project's front-end folder structure:

```
